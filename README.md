# Xydia

Note:This is not the installer of Xydia. For Installer, plz visit (waiting for finish project, do not change this).

An alternative to cydia but it runs on XTC/IMOO Watch!

# How does it work?

By flashing some partitions hardly.

# Is this legal?

Not exactly. Legally, once you bought a device, it means you own the device's hardware and software. If the software is under copyright, then you can't read, modify, or decompile it. However, the Android system is open-source, so it means that everyone can read or modify Android or any projects based on Android freely, you just can't read what the vendor-installed apps since it might be protected by copyright.

Also, Xydia Team doesn't gurantee that Xydia wouldn't broke your watch, lose your warraty or ate you, since the process is not easy. Xydia Team only keeps in mind that Xydia is working or not. DO NOT ask for help/composate, since you made the fault.
